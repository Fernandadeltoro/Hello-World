# Hello-World
Hello!, I am Fernanda. I am a computer programming student at El Paso Community College. I am an open-minded and critical thinker with a dream of combining my interests in computer science with neuroscience to achieve a positive impact within the medical field. Subjects such as Machine Learning, Automation, and Diplomacy excite me. My outside interests include Global Cuisine, International Documentaries, and Language Learning.

My overall passion is learning from the world and what it can show me, as well as meeting new people and their new perspectives. I do so by engaging in networking within my academic institutions such as reaching out to new students, especially under-represented communities, into the STEM sphere in Girls Who Code. Feel free to check my projects and experiences all listed below.
